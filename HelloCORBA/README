Demo illustrating JavaIDL (using IOR in file trick)

1. compile IDL

	idlj -fall HelloWorld.idl


2. Compile server client and stubs and skeletons
   (NOTE - ignore any compilation warnings at this stage)

	javac *.java HelloWorld/*.java


3. start server

	java HelloServer

which will produce output similar to the following:

stringified_ior = IOR:000000000000002c49444c3a647374632e6564752e61752f48656c6c6f576f726c642f48656c6c6f576f726c6449463a312e30000000000100000000000000300001000000000007627261686d7300009199000000000018afabcafe00000002320f648e000000080000000000000000
HelloServer ready and waiting ...


4. start client in another command tool

	java HelloClient

which will produce output similar to the following:

stringified_ior = IOR:000000000000002c49444c3a647374632e6564752e61752f48656c6c6f576f726c642f48656c6c6f576f726c6449463a312e30000000000100000000000000300001000000000007627261686d7300009199000000000018afabcafe00000002320f648e000000080000000000000000

Hello world !!


5.  See whether you can get your client to connect to another student's server, by swapping the "server.ref" files which contain the IOR of the executing server process.
