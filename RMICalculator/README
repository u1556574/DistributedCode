Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) Demo.
Written by Gary Allen, University of Huddersfield

A Java RMI Calculator.


*** This demo was updated to Java 1.8 in February 2019



The files:

CalculatorInterface.java - the interface defining the remote services available
CalculatorServer.java - the implementation of these remote services
CalculatorClient.java - a very simple command-line test client
SwingCalculatorClient.java - a more sophisticated SWING client


To use this demo:

1) Compile all files:

	javac *.java
	

2) Start the rmiregistry

	rmiregistry &


3) Start the server:
	java -classpath PathToCompiledClasses -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:PathToCompiledClasses/ CalculatorServer

Note that PathToCompiledClasses is the full pathname to the directory containing
the compiled version of the code, and that the trailing "/" IS essential on the 2nd parameter.
If you are following these instructions then PathToCompiledClasses will be the full path
name of the current directory where you are compiling and running this demo.

For Example:
	java -classpath /home/staff/gary/RMICalculator -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:/home/staff/gary/RMICalculator/ CalculatorServer

If you are running the demo in an IDE such as IntelliJ then put the 
	-classpath PathToCompiledClasses -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:PathToCompiledClasses/
into the VM arguments on the run configuration for the server.


4) In another shell tool, start the client:
	java SwingCalculatorClient

OR, if the client is running on a different machine to the server:
	java SwingCalculatorClient <hostname>

where <hostname> is replaced by the name of the machine that the server is
running on, e.g.:
	java SwingCalculatorClient dukas


PLEASE remember to kill server and the rmiregistry processes so as not
to leave loads of executing processes clogging up the machines!  To do
this (in the window you ran the server in):

	press "control-c" to kill the server
	type "fg" to bring the rmiregistry process to the foreground
	press "control-c" to kill the rmiregistry process
