Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) Demo.
Written by Gary Allen, University of Huddersfield

A Java RMI Calculator.


*** This demo was updated to Java 1.7 in December 2012
*** BUT when tested in September 2014 with the latest version of Java
*** it did not run from inside Eclipse but did run from the command line.
*** Need more time to work out what went wrong.  For now, follow the
*** instructions to run it from the command line OR work out why it didn't
*** work in eclipse and then tell me!


The files:

CalculatorInterface.java - the interface defining the remote services available
CalculatorServer.java - the implementation of these remote services
CalculatorClient.java - a very simple command-line test client
SwingCalculatorClient.java - a more sophisticated SWING client


To use this demo:

1) Compile all files:

	javac *.java
	

2) Start the rmiregistry

	rmiregistry &


3) Start the server:
	java -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:PathToCompiledInterfaceClass/ CalculatorServer

Note that PathToCompiledInterfaceClass/  is the full pathname to the directory containing
the compiled version of the CalculatorInterface class, and that the trailing "/" IS essential.
If you are following these instructions then PathToCompiledInterfaceClass/ will be the full path
name of the current directory where you are compiling and running this demo.

For Example:
	java -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:/home/staff2/gary/eclipseWorkspace/RMICalculator/bin/ CalculatorServer

If you are running the demo in eclipse then put the 
	-Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:PathToCompiledInterfaceClass/
into the VM arguments on the run configuration for the server.


4) In another shell tool, start the client:

	java SwingCalculatorClient
OR, if the client is running on a different machine to the server:

	java SwingCalculatorClient <hostname>
where <hostname> is replaced by the name of the machine that the server is
running on, e.g.:
	java SwingCalculatorClient dukas


PLEASE remember to kill server and the rmiregistry processes so as not
to leave loads of executing processes clogging up the machines!  To do
this (in the window you ran the server in):

	press "control-c" to kill the server
	type "fg" to bring the rmiregistry process to the foreground
	press "control-c" to kill the rmiregistry process
